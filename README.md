Passionate about the field of Cybersecurity and dedicated to solving complex problems. My journey in Computer Science has led me to delve into full-stack web development, where I built functional web applications. However, I eventually discovered my true passion lies in security. I am now eager to transition into a Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst role.
