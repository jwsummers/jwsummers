I’m Jason — a data-driven problem solver with a background in automotive diagnostics, operational analysis, and process improvement. After 20+ years identifying root causes, analyzing patterns, and improving workflows, I now apply the same mindset to data analytics using SQL, Python, Excel, and Power BI.

I’m drawn to work that involves investigating patterns, understanding *why* something is happening, and turning that into clear, actionable insights. My recent stretch role at CarMax involved reviewing repair orders, identifying labor overcharges, spotting systemic issues, and presenting findings to leadership — work that sparked my transition into analytics.

Here on GitHub, I'm building a portfolio focused on operational data, cost reduction, technician performance, and real-world analytics projects that demonstrate end-to-end thinking: data cleaning → analysis → insights → dashboards.

## 👋 About Me  
Quiet, analytical, and naturally curious — I’ve always been the person who needs to understand *why* something is happening. Data analytics lets me take that instinct and apply it in a structured, impactful way.

I’m currently seeking Data Analyst or Operations Analyst roles where I can contribute through root-cause investigation, operational insights, and clear data storytelling while continuing to grow and learn with a collaborative team.

Feel free to explore my projects or connect with me.
